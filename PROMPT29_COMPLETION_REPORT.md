## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Regime Classification Logic

```
Normalized ATR = ATR / Current_Price

if norm_ATR < 0.003:     regime = "low"     (conservative, higher risk)
elif norm_ATR >= 0.015:  regime = "high"    (aggressive, lower risk)
else:                    regime = "normal"   (standard parameters)
```

### Risk Parameter Adaptation

```yaml
low: { RISK_PCT: 0.012, SL_MULT: 1.3, TP_MULT: 2.2 } # More aggressive in calm markets
normal: { RISK_PCT: 0.010, SL_MULT: 1.5, TP_MULT: 2.0 } # Standard risk management
high: { RISK_PCT: 0.006, SL_MULT: 1.8, TP_MULT: 1.6 } # Conservative in volatile markets
```

## üìä VOLATILITY ADAPTATION LOGIC

### Risk Management Philosophy

- **Low Volatility (Calm Markets)**: Increase position size, tighter stops, higher targets
- **Normal Volatility (Standard Markets)**: Use default risk parameters
- **High Volatility (Turbulent Markets)**: Reduce position size, wider stops, modest targets

### Parameter Progression

```
RISK_PCT:  Low(1.2%) ‚Üí Normal(1.0%) ‚Üí High(0.6%)    [Inverse relationship]
SL_MULT:   Low(1.3x) ‚Üí Normal(1.5x) ‚Üí High(1.8x)    [Wider stops in volatility]
TP_MULT:   Low(2.2x) ‚Üí Normal(2.0x) ‚Üí High(1.6x)    [Lower targets in volatility]
```

### Regime Stability Features

- **Minimum Duration**: 3 bars before regime changes (prevents oscillations)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 85% consistency required for regime transitions
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to "normal" regime on errors
- **History Tracking**: Last 100 regime readings maintained for analysis
